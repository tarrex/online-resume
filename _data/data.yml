  details: |
    I am an experienced network engineer and system administrator with 10+ years of IT background. I am currently completing an advanced long-term training course for a DevOps engineer. I am going to develop my career in the DevOps direction.

    I have extensive experience in administering both Linux and Windows servers. I am also well versed in networks and network equipment (VPN, routing, OSPF, TCP / IP), I have worked and have experience in implementing version control systems and CI / CD (Gitea, GitLab, Jenkins), containerization and orchestration systems (Docker, Docker- compose, Kubernetes, ArgoCD), as well as monitoring and alerting systems (Zabbix, Nagios, Cacti, Grafana, Prometheus).

    My advanced IT experience is enriched by my economics education and high communication skills, which helps me to understand the business processes and needs and create and implement optimized solutions for the business, the team, and customers. I managed to cope with stressful situations. Usually, I don't tend to give up before difficulties. I try to find learnings from failures to improve the processes and my expertise. I am a fan of cohesive teamwork. People could rely on me.

    I am a curious explorer and fast learner, trying to develop my hard and soft skills. By the way, I like motorcycling, traveling, and scale modeling.
